# FreshNews Challenge 2.0 - Otomatika

The challenge was to create a RPA bot to get news from a website and save it on an Excel file, with title, date, description, picture filename, count the search phrase in title and description, if the title or the description contains an amount of money.

#### VS Code
1. The project was developed in Python (VS Code IDE) with [Robocorp] (https://www.robocorp.com)

## Input
The input must be a Robocorp Control Panel work item payload. 

## Results

🚀 After running the bot, check out the `output` folder for files (.xlsx with results).

  <summary>🙋‍♂️ "Why not just pip install...?"</summary>

Think of [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) as an equivalent of the requirements.txt, but much better. 👩‍💻 With `conda.yaml`, you are not just controlling your PyPI dependencies; you control the complete Python environment, which makes things repeatable and easy.

👉 You will probably need to run your code on another machine quite soon, so by using `conda.yaml`:
- You can avoid `Works on my machine` -cases
- You do not need to manage Python installations on all the machines
- You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on 
  - You'll also control the pip version to avoid dep. resolution changes
- No need for venv, pyenv, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
- Define dependencies in conda.yaml, let our tooling do the heavy lifting.
- You get all the content of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) without any extra tooling
